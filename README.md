# Pygame
This repo consists of my code to create several games based on pygame.  

To install the paclage requirements, run ```python
pip install -r requirements.txt```.
pygame is the only package that this game uses.

To run the game:
```python
python snake.py
```

Credits: The code is built following the pygame tutorials on [ClearCode youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFvqStqPCRU&ab_channel=ClearCode).
